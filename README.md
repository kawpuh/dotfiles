Install packages:
```bash
# Install all packages
stow gui term bin nix

stow bin    # Custom scripts
stow nix    # Nix configurations
```

Uninstall packages:
```bash
stow -D gui term bin nix
```

```bash
stow --adopt gui term bin nix
```
You can then
```bash
git restore .
```
if you just want to replace existing files with symlinks to stow.
